**I'm feeling bold and excited for this class**

_I like to call italics spicy font_

My favorite quote currently is from Nietzsche 
> “The snake which cannot cast its skin has to die. As well the minds which are prevented from changing their opinions; they cease to be mind.”

My top 3 videogame series are 
1. Kingdom Hearts
2. NieR Automata / Replicant
3. Omori

Some of my goals in life are:
- To continue growing academically and spiritually
- Be kind and mindful, appreciating every moment
- Work hard and get a rewarding job 
- ### GO BIRDS
