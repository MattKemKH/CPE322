## Lab 6 - Node.js and Pystache
### Node.js
I installed node.js. Then I made sure it was updated and assigned in my Path, and checked the versions with node -v and npm -v.
### node hello-world.js
I cd'd into the lesson 6 directory of iot and ran the file hello-world.js; it runs a webpage at the address http://127.0.0.1:3000/  that displays "Hello, World!"
### node hello.js
The file hello.js runs next; it runs a webpage at the address http://localhost:8080/ that displays "Hello World!" Whenever the page is opened or refreshed the terminal in which the page is running on sends
"response end call done"
"response end event fired"
### node http.js
The file https.js runs a webpage that displays "This page was refreshed X times!" where X is the number of times the page was refreshed. Each time the page is refreshed, 
the terminal outputs the number of times the page has been refreshed - 1
### Pystache Install
I installed Pystache, a Python implementation of Mustache, using pip install pystache. Then I cd'd back into lesson 6 of the iot repository directory.
### Pystache Commands
I ran the example code cat say_hello.mustache, cat say_hello.py, and python say_hello.py to see their outputs.
